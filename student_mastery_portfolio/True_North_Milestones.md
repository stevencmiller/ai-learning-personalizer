# True North Learning Milestones Framework

## Purpose
True North is committed to redefining what personalized, mastery-based education looks like in the 21st century. While we reject rigid, one-size-fits-all standards like Common Core, we believe students thrive when they have clear developmental checkpoints aligned with high-quality research.

This framework outlines three key checkpoints in a learner's journey:
- End of Elementary (Grade 5)
- End of Middle School (Grade 8)
- End of High School (Grade 12)

Each checkpoint is grounded in peer-reviewed developmental research and is organized by skill domains. These serve as broad guideposts for growth, not limitations.

## Implementation Principles
- These checkpoints serve as flexible roadmaps, not rigid gates.
- All milestones are adapted for each student’s level based on diagnostic assessments.
- Learning is nonlinear: students may excel in one domain while progressing gradually in another.
- Families, educators, and digital mentors collaborate to support milestone progress.

## Future Add-Ons (For Development)
- SEL + Soft Skills Diagnostic aligned with milestones
- Career Exploration Tracks mapped to Grade 12 outcomes
- Parent-facing dashboard with milestone summaries and growth evidence

This framework is intended to evolve as True North grows, but always rooted in purpose-driven, student-centered, and research-aligned learning.
