# True North Mentor Roundtable – Session 02  
## Handling Disagreement with Wisdom

🎙️ **Mentor Avatar Script:**

"Hey there. I’m so glad you’re here again.

Let’s start with a simple truth:  
You’re going to disagree with people in life.  
And that’s okay.

But how you handle disagreement? That can shape your character, your relationships, and even your future.

📖 **James 1:19 says:**  
‘Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.’

That’s not just advice.  
That’s wisdom. And it’s rare.

We live in a world where people shout to be heard — and scroll past people who think differently.  
But what if disagreement could actually be a doorway to deeper understanding?

💡 **Today’s Big Truth:**  
You can disagree with someone and still treat them with respect.

It doesn’t mean you give up what you believe.  
It means you stay rooted — in truth, and in love.

🔄 **Reflection Prompts:**
- How do you usually respond when someone disagrees with you?  
- Have you ever felt misunderstood — and what helped?  
- How has social media changed the way people treat each other during disagreements?

💬 **Your Challenge:**
Next time you feel anger rise during a conversation…  
→ Pause.  
→ Breathe.  
→ And then ask:  
"What would it look like to respond with respect?"

If you follow Jesus, that might mean offering a prayer for peace in that moment.  
If you're not sure what you believe yet, you can still choose calm — and choose dignity — over outrage.

Both are powerful. Both are rare. And both change the world.

🛐 **Closing Prayer (Christian):**
Lord,  
Help me listen with humility.  
Speak with courage.  
And love with gentleness — even when I disagree.  
Let my words reflect Your heart. Amen.

🌿 **Closing Statement (Non-religious):**
You don’t have to agree with everyone.  
But if you treat people with honor and stay calm when it’s hard…  
You’re already growing in wisdom. And that matters.

Thanks for showing up today. You’re becoming the kind of leader the world needs."
