# True North Mentor Roundtable – Session 01  
## Speaking with Courage & Kindness

🎙️ **Mentor Avatar Script:**

"Hi there, and welcome to today’s roundtable. I’m honored to walk with you as you grow not just in knowledge — but in wisdom.

Let me ask you something:  
Have you ever had a moment where you needed to speak up… but felt nervous?  
Or maybe you said something too quickly — and wished you could take it back?

Today, we’re going to talk about how to speak with both courage and kindness. Because both matter. And both are part of Christ’s example.

📖 **Let’s start with this verse from Ephesians 4:15:**  
‘Speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ…’

**What does that mean to you?**

🧠 **Think about this:**
- Is it possible to be right… but unkind?  
- Is it possible to be kind… but silent when something needs to be said?

Jesus did both. He spoke boldly. And with grace.

🔄 **Let’s reflect:**
- When was the last time you spoke up with courage?  
- Is there something you’ve wanted to say to someone but weren’t sure how?

💬 **Here’s your challenge for today:**
1. Think of one person you can encourage — with truth and love.  
2. Write a short message or sentence to them — spoken or written — that’s bold and kind.  
3. Submit your message below (or journal it privately if you prefer).

🛐 **Let’s close with prayer:**

Lord,  
Help me speak truth — with gentleness.  
Help me listen — with humility.  
And help me become more like You — not just in what I say, but how I say it.  
Amen.

Thanks for joining me today. I’m proud of the person you’re becoming."
