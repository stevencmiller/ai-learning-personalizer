# True North Cross-Curricular Standards & Learning Targets

## Vision:
These integrated learning experiences are designed to blend academic content from two or more subject areas in a meaningful way. The goal is to accelerate mastery, foster relevance, and support the 2-hour core compact model by showing how knowledge connects across disciplines.

## üåç Sample Cross-Curricular Modules

### 1. "Data Detectives" (Math + Science)
**Grade Level:** 6‚Äì8  
**Big Idea:** Students use statistical reasoning to analyze environmental data.

**Standards Alignment:**
- Math: Represent and interpret data using line plots, histograms, and box plots (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.SP.B.4)  
- Science: Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence for the effects of resource availability on organisms (NGSS MS-LS2-1)

**Learning Targets:**
- I can organize and visualize real-world data using graphs.  
- I can interpret patterns and make predictions based on data trends.  
- I can explain how changes in an ecosystem affect the balance of life.

### 2. "The Geometry of Architecture" (Math + Social Studies + Art)
**Grade Level:** 7‚Äì9  
**Big Idea:** Students study geometric principles through famous buildings and cultural structures.

**Standards Alignment:**
- Math: Solve problems involving angle measure, surface area, and volume (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.G)

### 3. "Debate the Data" (ELA + Math + Civics)
**Grade Level:** 6‚Äì8  
**Big Idea:** Students interpret data and use persuasive writing to debate a public policy issue.

**Standards Alignment:**
- ELA: Write arguments to support claims with logical reasoning and relevant evidence (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.7.1)
- Math: Understand ratios and use them to analyze real-world relationships (CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.RP.A.3)
- Civics: Engage in civil discourse and use evidence to form reasoned opinions (C3 Framework D2.Civ.8.6-8)

**Learning Targets:**
- I can analyze data and use it to support a claim.  
- I can participate in a debate using evidence-based reasoning.  
- I can write a persuasive letter to a public official based on my findings.

### 4. "STEM Storytellers" (ELA + Science + Tech)
**Grade Level:** 4‚Äì6  
**Big Idea:** Students write a narrative from the point of view of an animal or natural element.

**Standards Alignment:**
- ELA: Develop real or imagined narratives with descriptive details (CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.W.4.3)
- Science: Construct an explanation of how animals use their senses (NGSS 4-LS1-2)
- Technology: Use digital tools to publish and present work (ISTE Standards)

**Learning Targets:**
- I can write a narrative that integrates scientific understanding.  
- I can explain how animals use senses to survive.  
- I can use digital tools to enhance my story.
