# 🌟 True North: AI Learning Personalizer

**Empowering Every Learner. Grounded in Purpose. Guided by Faith.**

The True North Learning initiative is an AI-powered personalized learning platform designed to equip students with core academic mastery, critical life skills, and spiritual grounding for the journey ahead. This open-source project combines diagnostic-driven curriculum mapping, adaptive pathways, and future-ready modules in a two-hour core learning model—launching first as a Wyoming private school, with future expansion across the U.S.
