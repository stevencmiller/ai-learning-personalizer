# 📊 AI-Powered Learning Personalizer (Pilot: 8th Grade Math)

> A mastery-based learning engine powered by diagnostic pre-assessments, personalized skill paths, and dynamic progress monitoring — built for real student growth.

---

## 🧠 What Problem This Solves  
Students often receive grade-level instruction that doesn’t reflect what they’re truly ready to learn. This project replaces GPA-based assumptions with diagnostic pre-assessments that pinpoint each student's entry point and generate a personalized vertical learning plan aligned to key standards.

---

## 👤 Target Users  
- Students (initial pilot: 8th Grade Math)  
- Teachers viewing student readiness, gaps, and growth  
- (Optional) Parents receiving weekly skill updates  

---

## 📥 Inputs  
- Pre-assessment scores per student, aligned to specific standards (e.g. CCSS.Math.Content.8.EE.1)  
- Optional: past standardized test data or placement exam results  
- Student name/ID and optional background info  

---

## 📤 Outputs  
- Personalized Learning Plan based on diagnostic results  
- Mastery tracker for each skill within the learning path  
- Streamlit dashboard showing current level, progress, and suggested next steps  
- Optional GPT-generated lesson prompts or visual explanations  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- Python (Pandas for data processing)  
- Streamlit (app interface)  
- Altair or Matplotlib (for visualization)  
- Optional: GPT-4 for explanation generation or lesson prompts  
- Standards reference set (e.g., Common Core)  

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- Upload mock or real student diagnostic data  
- System identifies vertical entry point based on gaps  
- Personalized skill roadmap is generated  
- Dashboard displays learning trajectory with mastery visualization  
- Optional: exportable PDF or printable learning plan for teacher/parent
