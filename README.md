# ai-learning-personalizer
Great call, Steven — let’s absolutely prep this in markdown format now. Even if you’re not ready to fully code it today, creating the GitHub project structure early is a solid move. It sets the intention and makes it easier to track progress as you build.

Here’s the markdown version of your Portfolio Project #1 — you can copy and paste this into a new GitHub README.md file:

# 📊 AI-Powered Learning Personalizer (Pilot: 8th Grade Math)

> Standards-aligned, data-informed learning paths personalized for every student — powered by pre-assessments and AI.

---

## 🧠 Problem This Solves  
Traditional education often relies on GPA or generic benchmarks to guide instruction. This project enables personalized learning by analyzing student performance on diagnostic assessments and generating custom learning paths aligned to specific standards (e.g., Common Core or state frameworks).

---

## 👤 Target Users  
- Students (Middle School; initial pilot = 8th Grade Math)  
- Teachers viewing student gaps and suggested plans  
- (Optional) Parents receiving summary reports  

---

## 📥 Inputs  
- Student CSV containing:
  - Unique ID / Name  
  - Pre-assessment scores by standard or skill  
  - Optional: historical test scores  

---

## 📤 Outputs  
- Personalized Learning Plan (skill-by-skill roadmap)  
- Visual mastery tracker  
- Streamlit dashboard view  
- Optional AI recommendation summary (GPT-generated learning tips or links)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- Python (Pandas for data processing)  
- Streamlit (app interface)  
- Altair (charts/graphs)  
- Optional GPT integration (Phase 2)  
- CSV data upload & dashboard generation

---

## ✅ Success Criteria  
- Upload student dataset  
- Automatically identify which standards are mastered, developing, or not met  
- Output personalized learning path for each student  
- Display dashboard showing key metrics and learning targets

---

## 🔭 Future Add-Ons (Phase 2+)  
- Retention Risk Scoring (AI School Coach)  
- Parent Dashboard Output  
- AI-generated lesson plan suggestions  
- Project-based learning menu tied to current skills

---

## 📂 Project Status  
🚧 In development – structure created, data pipeline next.
