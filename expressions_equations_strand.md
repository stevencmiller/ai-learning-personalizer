# True North Math Strand Map: Expressions & Equations (Grades 3–9)

## Vision:
This vertical strand map outlines the progression of concepts related to expressions and equations from foundational skills through early high school algebra. It will serve as the foundation for True North’s Math Diagnostic Engine and PDLE lesson mapping.

---

## 🎯 Pre-Grade 4 “Readiness Anchor” (Minimum Proficiency Expectations)
Before entering the formal vertical progression, learners should demonstrate foundational skills such as:
- Fluency with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division facts (up to 12×12)
- Understanding place value to the thousands
- Introduction to variables using symbols (e.g., 5 + □ = 12)
- Solving basic one-step word problems

🔁 If not yet mastered, students are placed into the Pre-Mastery Path with targeted lessons, fluency games, and number sense activities.

### 📝 Diagnostic Questions (Pre-4 Readiness)
1. What is 8 × 7?
2. What number makes this true: 14 + __ = 25?
3. Which number sentence matches: “If you divide 36 by some number you get 6”
4. Fill in the blank: 5 + □ = 12

## 📘 Vertical Strand Progression: Expressions & Equations

### Grade 4:
- Represent multiplication/division using equations
- Identify unknowns in simple equations (e.g., 4 × __ = 20)
- Use symbols to represent unknown quantities

#### 📝 Diagnostic Questions:
1. Which of these equations shows 4 groups of 6? (a) 4 + 6 (b) 4 × 6 (c) 6 ÷ 4
2. Solve: 7 × □ = 28
3. Match the expression to the model: “Five more than a number” → □ + 5

---

### Grade 5:
- Write and interpret numerical expressions (e.g., 3 × (4 + 5))
- Translate verbal statements into expressions
- Understand the order of operations (no parentheses nesting)

#### 📝 Diagnostic Questions:
1. What is the value of: 3 × (6 + 2)?
2. Write an expression for: “Double the sum of 5 and 3”
3. Which shows the correct order of operations: (a) add then multiply, (b) multiply then add

---

### Grade 6:
- Evaluate expressions with grouping symbols
- Identify parts of expressions (terms, coefficients, variables)
- Use variables to write simple expressions

#### 📝 Diagnostic Questions:
1. Evaluate: (4 + 3) × 2
2. Which is a variable? (a) 7 (b) x (c) =
3. Write an expression for: “7 less than a number”

---

### Grade 7:
- Solve multi-step problems with variables and equations
- Apply distributive property and combine like terms
- Evaluate expressions with substitution

#### 📝 Diagnostic Questions:
1. Simplify: 3(x + 2)
2. Combine like terms: 2x + 3x + 5
3. Solve: 2(x - 1) = 10

---

### Grade 8:
- Solve linear equations in one variable
- Understand and check solutions
- Identify equivalent expressions

#### 📝 Diagnostic Questions:
1. Solve: 5x - 3 = 2x + 6
2. Which expression is equivalent to: 4(x - 2)?
3. Is x = 2 a solution to: 3x + 4 = 10? Show work.

---

### Grade 9:
- Solve systems of linear equations
- Model relationships with equations (y = mx + b)
- Begin solving quadratic equations

#### 📝 Diagnostic Questions:
1. Solve the system:  
   x + y = 6  
   x - y = 2
2. What is the slope in y = 2x - 5?
3. Which equation represents a parabola? (a) y = 3x (b) y = x² + 2x - 1

## 🧠 Next Steps:
- Add questions to diagnostic scoring engine
- Define PDLE lesson sequences per level (Pre-4 to 9th)
- Cross-reference standards (CCSS, state-specific)
- Add to GitHub under /diagnostic_engine/math
