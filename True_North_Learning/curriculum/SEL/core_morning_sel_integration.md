## Core Morning SEL Integration

### 1. Morning Launch (Spiritual & SEL Fusion)
- **Devotional / Scripture Focus (5 mins)**  
  Anchored in a theme for the week (hope, resilience, integrity, etc.)

- **Mindfulness or Breath Exercise (2–3 mins)**  
  Ground students in calm, focus, and presence.

- **"Check-In Circle" Prompt (5–10 mins)**  
  Students respond to a rotating prompt:
  - “One word that describes how I feel today…”
  - “A challenge I’m working through is…”
  - “One way I want to grow this week…”

> **Tools:** Digital journal entry, emoji check-ins, or quick audio clips (age-dependent)
