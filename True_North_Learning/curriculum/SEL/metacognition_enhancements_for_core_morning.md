## Metacognition Enhancements for Core Morning

### 1. Morning Launch: Metacognitive Prompts
- Add "Think Spot" Journal:  
  > "What am I most ready to learn today?"  
  > "What thinking trap do I want to avoid this week?"

- Add a visual model of the metacognitive cycle:
  > Plan → Monitor → Evaluate

### 2. Academic Block Integration
- **Mini Checkpoints**:  
  Ask students mid-task:  
  > “How do I know this is working?”  
  > “What strategy am I using—and is it helping?”

- **Post-Task Debrief**:  
  > “What did I do well today—and how do I know?”

---

### 3. Daily Reflection
- Include "Meta-Moment" in the reflection:  
  > “What did I learn about how I learn?”  
  > “What mindset helped or blocked me today?”

- Optional use of visual trackers (emoji meter, success scale, etc.)

### Weekly Challenge Example:
> “Notice your self-talk when you’re stuck. Write down one shift you made this week.”
