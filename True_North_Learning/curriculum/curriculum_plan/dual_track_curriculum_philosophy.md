# True North Hybrid Education: Dual-Track Curriculum Philosophy

## Introduction

At **True North**, our mission is to provide a **faith-centered, flexible educational model** that meets the diverse needs of families while staying true to biblical principles. To ensure inclusivity while remaining faithful to our Christian values, we offer a **dual-track curriculum** that allows families to choose between a **faith-based** or **worldview-neutral** track.

This approach is designed to maintain our commitment to **biblical teachings** while respecting the unique beliefs of each family. Both tracks share the same foundational educational content but are differentiated in terms of **worldview integration** and the handling of controversial topics like evolution and old-earth theory.

## Dual-Track Curriculum Overview

### 1. **Faith-Based Track**
This track is intended for families who desire to integrate their **Christian faith** with their education. The curriculum is explicitly **biblical** and framed through a **Creation-based** perspective.

- **Scripture Integration**: Each lesson includes biblical principles that reinforce the subject matter, helping students see their learning in the context of God's design.
- **Creation Science**: Topics like **Origins of Life**, **Biology**, **Earth Science**, and **Cosmology** are taught from a **young earth perspective** or **Intelligent Design** view.
- **Ethical Discussions**: Moral issues and dilemmas are framed through the lens of **biblical ethics**, encouraging students to develop a strong Christian worldview.
- **Apologetics**: Students are encouraged to engage with questions of faith and reason, building the capacity to defend their beliefs in a respectful, informed manner.

### 2. **Worldview-Neutral Track**
This track is designed for families who prefer an educational approach that respects their values but without explicit faith integration. It offers a **secular educational experience** that **excludes evolution and old-earth theory**, while still maintaining a **critical thinking approach**.

- **Observational Science**: The science curriculum focuses on **empirical evidence**, **scientific method**, and **systems thinking**, avoiding controversial theories like evolution and old-earth theory.
- **Core Ethical Topics**: Students learn about ethics, morality, and personal responsibility, emphasizing **critical thinking** and respect for diverse viewpoints without promoting relativism.
- **Family-Led Faith Integration**: Families are encouraged to introduce their faith discussions at home, with optional faith-based enrichment if desired.

## Curriculum Structure

| Feature                | **Faith-Based Track**           | **Neutral Track**                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Worldview**           | Christian (Biblical Creation)   | Values-respecting / Inclusive    |
| **Scripture Integration** | Yes                            | No (but allows for home discussion) |
| **Creation View**       | Young Earth / Intelligent Design | Omits origins debate entirely   |
| **Ethical Topics**      | Biblical Ethics                 | Ethical Thinking & Critical Reflection |
| **Parent Opt-In**       | Default for Christian families  | Optional at enrollment          |

## How This Approach Works

Both tracks share a core curriculum, ensuring **academic rigor** and **knowledge transfer** in each subject area. The key difference lies in the **philosophical framework** and how **sensitive topics** are addressed.

- **80â€“90% of the content** in each subject (Math, ELA, Science, etc.) will be identical between the two tracks. The variation occurs primarily in how **controversial topics** such as **evolution**, **origins**, and **ethics** are taught.
- **Faith-based content** will be presented through **sidebars**, **reflection prompts**, or **discussion points** in the faith-based track. These elements allow families to **intentionally engage with scripture** while exploring the subject matter.
- For assignments and journaling, students will be able to toggle between **faith-based or worldview-neutral approaches**, based on the track chosen by their family.
  
## Parent and Student Empowerment

This dual-track system provides **flexibility**, allowing families to select the track that best aligns with their values. Whether they choose to have explicit faith integration or prefer a neutral track, students will still receive a **strong academic foundation** while learning to think critically, respect others' beliefs, and engage with the world in a thoughtful and responsible manner.

- **Faith-Based Track**: Encourages students to **live out their faith** in the academic world and equips them with the tools to defend their beliefs.
- **Worldview-Neutral Track**: Provides students with an **ethical framework** and **scientific literacy** that respects family autonomy while avoiding controversial theories like evolution.

## Conclusion

The **True North Hybrid Model** is designed to allow **families the choice to either embrace an overtly Christian worldview** or follow a **neutral approach**, while still receiving the same high-quality education. This dual-track curriculum enables us to stay true to our Christian convictions while providing **flexibility**, **academic rigor**, and **respect** for the unique needs and values of each family.
