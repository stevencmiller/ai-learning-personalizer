## 1. Physical Science: God's Order in Motion

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Investigate properties of matter (mass, volume, etc.) | Emphasize the order and consistency in God's creation | Use real-world examples to highlight stewardship |
| Understand conservation of mass in physical changes | God's laws in creation are consistent and observable | Connect to biblical themes of constancy and truth |
| Explore energy transfer (sound, light, heat, electricity) | Explore the beauty and structure of God’s physical laws | Examples of divine design in complexity |

## 2. Life Science: The Design of Living Things

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Understand plant and animal systems | Teach complexity as evidence of intelligent design | Tie to Genesis — kinds producing after their kind |
| Learn about ecosystems and food webs | Emphasize balance and stewardship in God’s creation | Assign stewardship-based projects |
| Examine traits and heredity | Present as designed systems, not random evolution | May introduce microevolution vs. design discussion |

## Faith-Integrated Emphases for Grade 5

- **Key Scriptures**:
  - Genesis 1–2 (Creation Account)
  - Psalm 19:1 (The heavens declare the glory of God)
  - Romans 1:20 (God’s invisible qualities seen in nature)

- **Critical Thinking Integration**:
  - Compare secular theories (e.g., uniformitarianism, Big Bang) with biblical creationism.
  - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of scientific models from multiple worldviews.

- **Sample Reflection Prompt**:
  > “How does the complexity of a plant cell point to God as Creator? How can we steward the living world He gave us?”
