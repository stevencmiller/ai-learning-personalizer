## 1. Cellular Biology: Building Blocks of Life

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Structure and function of cells | Present cells as evidence of intelligent design | Psalm 139:13–14 |

## 2. Genetics & Heredity: Order and Uniqueness by Design

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| DNA structure and function | Marvel at God’s “code of life” | Highlight irreducible complexity |
| Mendelian genetics, traits, inheritance | Reinforce predictability and order in God’s creation |
| Mutations and variation | Address microadaptation; avoid macroevolution claims | Clarify “variation within kinds” (Genesis 1)

## 3. Ecology & Environment: Stewardship of Creation

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Ecosystems, energy flow, food webs | Emphasize balance and sustainability by design |
| Human impact and conservation | Connect to biblical stewardship (Genesis 2:15) |
| Biomes and biodiversity | Showcase God’s creativity and care |

## 4. Human Anatomy & Physiology: Fearfully and Wonderfully Made

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Body systems and interactions | Celebrate the complexity and harmony of human biology |
| Nervous, circulatory, digestive, etc. | Link to Scripture and the imago Dei |
| Reproductive system (age-appropriate) | Frame with dignity, purity, and God’s design for life |

---

## 5. Scientific Inquiry & Bioethics

| NGSS/State Standard | Faith-Aligned Interpretation | Notes |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Hypothesis formation, observation, data analysis | Teach critical thinking as a way to understand God’s world |
| Ethical implications in biology | Introduce worldview questions, e.g., when does life begin? |

## Faith-Integrated Emphases for Biology

- **Avoidance**: Macro-evolution, common ancestry, natural selection as sole driver of change
- **Alternative Focus**:
  - Intelligent Design
  - Creation biology models (e.g., Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation Research)
  - Encouragement of respectful discourse on origins

- **Key Scriptures**:
  - Genesis 1:26 – Created in God's image
  - Psalm 139:14 – Fearfully and wonderfully made
  - Colossians 1:16–17 – All things were created through Him

- **Sample Reflection Prompt**:
  > “How does the complexity of the cell reflect the nature of its Creator?”
