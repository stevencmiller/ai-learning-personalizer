## üîç Observations

**High Alignment:**  
- All three frameworks emphasize core ideas in physical, life, and earth/space sciences.  
- Inquiry and science practices are strongly present across standards.

**Distinct Differences:**  
- **NGSS** is more performance-based and includes engineering connections.  
- **Wyoming** integrates local context and resource use.  
- **NSES** is more general but foundational for science education philosophy.
