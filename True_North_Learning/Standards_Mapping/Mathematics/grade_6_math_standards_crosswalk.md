# üìä Grade 6 Math Standards Crosswalk: NCTM, Common Core, and Wyoming

This crosswalk compares Grade 6 math standards from three major frameworks to inform curriculum alignment, lesson development, and diagnostic assessment planning.

## 1. Ratios & Proportional Relationships

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Understand ratio concepts; use ratio reasoning to solve problems. |
| **Wyoming**         | Same as Common Core, including unit rates, tables, graphs, and equations. |
| **NCTM**            | Develop understanding of proportional reasoning; apply to real-life contexts. |

---

## 2. The Number System

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Divide fractions; compute fluently with multi-digit numbers and decimals; understand negative numbers. |
| **Wyoming**         | Master four operations with decimals and fractions; place rational numbers on a number line. |
| **NCTM**            | Expand number sense to include rational numbers; deepen operations and estimation skills. |

---

## 3. Expressions & Equations

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Write, evaluate, and simplify expressions; solve one-variable equations and inequalities. |
| **Wyoming**         | Analyze and use variables, numerical expressions, and properties of operations. |
| **NCTM**            | Represent and analyze quantitative relationships; use symbolic algebra to solve problems. |

## 4. Geometry

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Solve area, surface area, and volume problems involving polygons and 3D shapes. |
| **Wyoming**         | Same as Common Core, including nets, polygons, and real-world applications. |
| **NCTM**            | Explore geometric relationships; connect geometry to measurement and spatial reasoning. |

---

## 5. Statistics & Probability

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Develop understanding of statistical variability; summarize and describe data distributions. |
| **Wyoming**         | Interpret data using graphs and measures of center; explore variability. |
| **NCTM**            | Collect, organize, and analyze data; make inferences and predictions. |

## üîç Observations

### High Alignment:
- Strong overlap in **ratios**, **expressions**, and **geometry**.
- All three systems emphasize **data analysis** and foundational **algebraic thinking**.

### NCTM's Approach:
- Emphasizes **reasoning**, **representational fluency**, and **mathematical habits of mind**.
- Encourages **flexible problem-solving** and integration with real-world scenarios.
