## 1. Ratios & Proportional Relationships

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world problems. |
| **Wyoming**         | Same as Common Core, with a focus on percentages, proportions, and multistep ratio problems. |
| **NCTM**            | Deepen understanding of proportional reasoning; apply scaling and similarity. |

## 2. The Number System

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Operations with rational numbers, including negatives and absolute value. |
| **Wyoming**         | Extend number sense to signed numbers and operations with rational numbers. |
| **NCTM**            | Build fluency with integers and rational numbers; emphasize number sense and estimation. |

## 3. Expressions & Equations

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Solve problems using linear expressions and equations; analyze real-life contexts. |
| **Wyoming**         | Model real-world problems using algebraic reasoning; use equations to solve them. |
| **NCTM**            | Develop symbolic reasoning; connect expressions and equations to real-life applications. |

## 4. Geometry

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures; solve problems involving angles, circles, area, surface area, and volume. |
| **Wyoming**         | Apply and solve problems using geometric formulas; use informal constructions. |
| **NCTM**            | Develop spatial reasoning; explore transformations and symmetry; apply measurement concepts. |

## 5. Statistics & Probability

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Use random sampling to draw inferences; draw comparisons between populations; investigate chance processes. |
| **Wyoming**         | Same as Common Core; includes focus on statistical variability and probability models. |
| **NCTM**            | Use data to make predictions; understand probability concepts; design and analyze statistical experiments. |

## üîç Observations

### High Alignment:
- Strong overlap in **rational number operations**, **proportional reasoning**, and **basic algebra**.
- Emphasis across all frameworks on **data literacy** and **geometric understanding**.

### NCTM‚Äôs Approach:
- Reinforces **conceptual understanding** and real-world application.
- Focuses on **habits of mind**, such as reasoning, justifying, and representing problems in multiple ways.
