# üìä Grade 8 Math Standards Crosswalk: NCTM, Common Core, and Wyoming

This crosswalk compares Grade 8 math standards from Common Core, Wyoming State Standards, and NCTM focal points to guide diagnostic development, lesson alignment, and curriculum decisions.

---

## 1. The Number System

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Work with irrational numbers; approximate and locate them on a number line. |
| **Wyoming**         | Same as Common Core; includes understanding decimal expansions and roots. |
| **NCTM**            | Emphasize rational vs. irrational numbers and number properties. |

---

## 2. Expressions & Equations

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Analyze and solve linear equations and systems of linear equations. |
| **Wyoming**         | Solve real-world problems using linear models and multi-step equations. |
| **NCTM**            | Connect algebraic reasoning to linear relationships and functional thinking. |

## 3. Functions

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Define, evaluate, and compare functions; use them to model relationships. |
| **Wyoming**         | Identify, interpret, and compare linear and non-linear functions. |
| **NCTM**            | Focus on the concept of function and its role in modeling relationships. |

---

## 4. Geometry

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Understand congruence and similarity through transformations; work with Pythagorean Theorem; solve problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres. |
| **Wyoming**         | Apply transformations; use formulas; prove and apply the Pythagorean Theorem. |
| **NCTM**            | Apply geometric reasoning to transformations, coordinates, and similarity. |

---

## 5. Statistics & Probability

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Investigate patterns of association in bivariate data. |
| **Wyoming**         | Use scatter plots and lines of best fit to model and interpret relationships. |
| **NCTM**            | Explore associations between variables and draw conclusions from data. |

## üîç Observations

### High Alignment:
- Broad consensus across all frameworks in focusing on **functions**, **linear equations**, and **transformational geometry**.
- Strong real-world connections in statistics, especially bivariate analysis.

### NCTM‚Äôs Approach:
- Stresses **conceptual depth** and modeling.
- Introduces **functions and algebraic reasoning** as foundational to higher-level mathematics.
