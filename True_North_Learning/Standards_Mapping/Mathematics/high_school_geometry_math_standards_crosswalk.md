## üîç Observations

### **High Alignment:**
- Strong alignment between all three frameworks on **core geometric concepts**.
- Modeling and transformations are emphasized by **NCTM** and **CCSS**, with **Wyoming closely following**.

### **Notable Differences:**
- **NCTM** emphasizes **conceptual exploration and reasoning** over procedural fluency.
- **CCSS** and **Wyoming** are more explicit in performance expectations and coding.
- **Proofs and logic** are stressed in NCTM and more procedural in CCSS.
