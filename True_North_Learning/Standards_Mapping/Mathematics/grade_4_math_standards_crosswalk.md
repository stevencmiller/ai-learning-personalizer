# üìä Grade 4 Math Standards Crosswalk  
**Comparing NCTM, Common Core, and Wyoming State Standards**

This document provides a crosswalk of key Grade 4 mathematics standards across three major frameworks:  
- **Common Core State Standards (CCSS)**  
- **Wyoming State Standards**  
- **National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Focal Points**

It is designed to identify commonalities and outliers, inform diagnostic assessment design, and support curriculum development that is adaptable to school or family-selected standards.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Alignment

- **Common Core and Wyoming**: High alignment; Wyoming‚Äôs standards are nearly identical to CCSS for Grade 4 Math.  
- **NCTM**: Broader grade-band focus, but core concepts align well. Emphasis is placed more on conceptual understanding, problem-solving, and reasoning than grade-specific benchmarks.

## üóÇÔ∏è Next Steps

1. Extend this crosswalk to Grades 5 through 9.  
2. Use aligned standards to build diagnostic blueprint items that assess core overlapping concepts.  
3. Identify outlier standards for optional/custom inclusion during school onboarding.  
4. Use this foundation to support tagging of curriculum, lessons, and auto-generated pathways.
