## üîç Observations

### **High Alignment:**
- Algebra I is **well aligned** across all three frameworks in structure and intent.
- Emphasis on **functions, equations, and modeling** is consistently reinforced.

### **Notable Differences:**
- **NCTM** leans more conceptual (reasoning, modeling, structure).
- **Common Core & Wyoming** are more explicitly standards-driven but share most objectives.
- Wyoming **uses different codes** but the content mirrors CCSS closely.
