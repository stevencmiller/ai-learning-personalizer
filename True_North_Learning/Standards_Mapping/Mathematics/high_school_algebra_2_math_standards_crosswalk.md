## üîç Observations

### **High Alignment:**
- Strong agreement on core **functions**, **modeling**, and **polynomial algebra**.
- **Exponential and logarithmic** function integration is solid across all three.

### **Notable Differences:**
- **NCTM** prioritizes conceptual understanding and **recursive patterns**.
- **Common Core** has tighter structure around **standards coding** and assessments.
- **Wyoming** expands slightly into deeper **series and statistics** topics.
