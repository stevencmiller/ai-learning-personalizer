# üìä Grade 5 Math Standards Crosswalk: NCTM, Common Core, and Wyoming

This document provides a side-by-side comparison of 5th Grade Math Standards across three major frameworks to identify overlaps and outliers, inform curriculum design, and guide diagnostic assessment planning.

## 1. Operations & Algebraic Thinking

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Write and interpret numerical expressions; analyze patterns and relationships. |
| **Wyoming**         | Use parentheses, brackets, or braces in numerical expressions; write and interpret numerical expressions without evaluating. |
| **NCTM**            | Understand patterns, relations, and functions; represent and analyze mathematical situations using algebraic symbols. |

## 2. Number & Operations in Base Ten

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Understand the place value system; perform operations with multi-digit whole numbers and decimals to hundredths. |
| **Wyoming**         | Recognize place value relationships; read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths; perform multi-digit operations. |
| **NCTM**            | Understand number representations and relationships; compute fluently; make reasonable estimates. |

## 3. Number & Operations‚ÄîFractions

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators; multiply and divide fractions. |
| **Wyoming**         | Solve problems with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions and mixed numbers. |
| **NCTM**            | Deepen understanding of fractions; use operations to solve contextual problems; emphasize conceptual reasoning. |

## 4. Measurement & Data

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Convert units; represent data; understand volume and relate it to operations. |
| **Wyoming**         | Convert measurement units; interpret data in line plots; understand and apply volume formulas. |
| **NCTM**            | Understand measurable attributes; apply tools and techniques; collect and analyze data. |

---

## 5. Geometry

| **Standard Source** | **Focus** |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Common Core**     | Graph points on coordinate plane; classify two-dimensional figures by properties. |
| **Wyoming**         | Same as Common Core. |
| **NCTM**            | Analyze characteristics of geometric shapes; describe spatial relationships using coordinate geometry. |

## üîç Observations

### High Alignment:
- All three frameworks emphasize **conceptual understanding**, **problem-solving**, and **real-world application**.
- Geometry and operations with fractions show **nearly complete alignment**.

### NCTM's Approach:
- Broader and more flexible, focusing on **process standards** and **mathematical thinking**.
- Strong emphasis on **reasoning**, **communication**, and **connections**‚Äîkey values for a private/hybrid model like *True North*.
