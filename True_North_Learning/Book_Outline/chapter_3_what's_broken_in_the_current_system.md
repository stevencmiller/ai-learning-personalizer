# Chapter 3: What’s Broken in the Current System?

To move forward, we must first acknowledge where we are—and why it’s not working.

The traditional education system was designed for a different time. Its roots trace back to the industrial era, where efficiency, compliance, and standardization were paramount. Students were trained to follow instructions, stay in line, and perform on command. But the world has changed—and education hasn’t kept pace.

Today’s students are digital natives. They live in a complex, fast-changing world that demands adaptability, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and creativity. Yet they often sit in rows, follow scripted curriculum, and are judged by standardized test scores that don’t capture their potential.

We see the cracks everywhere:

- Rising levels of anxiety and disengagement among students.
- Teachers burned out by bureaucracy, paperwork, and testing mandates.
- Parents frustrated by one-size-fits-all instruction that doesn't meet their child’s needs.
- A widening gap between school experiences and real-world relevance.

Worst of all, we’ve lost the *why* behind learning. Students ask, “When will I ever use this?”—and too often, we don’t have a good answer.

True North Learning doesn’t pretend the system isn’t broken. It faces the reality head-on. But rather than giving up, it invites us to reimagine—to build something better. Something that centers students, not systems. Purpose, not points. Growth, not grades.

This chapter outlines the pain points we must fix—and why our current trajectory is unsustainable.
