# Preface

**True North Learning** was born out of a deep conviction: the traditional education system, while well-intentioned, is no longer meeting the evolving needs of students and families. As a lifelong educator, curriculum leader, and follower of Christ, I have witnessed firsthand the growing disconnect between what students *need* to thrive in today’s world and what schools are currently able to provide.

This book is not simply a critique—it is a vision. A vision rooted in hope, innovation, and faith. A belief that we can reimagine school to be more personalized, more purpose-driven, and more connected to students’ hearts and minds. This is about giving students a compass—a “true north”—to guide their learning, growth, and identity in a world filled with noise and distraction.

In these pages, you will explore the theory and heart behind True North Learning. You’ll discover the challenges we face in today’s system and the bold opportunities that lie ahead when we commit to a better way—one that nurtures not just academic achievement but also spiritual formation, curiosity, and a lifelong love of learning.

This book is not a detailed manual. It’s a conversation starter. It’s an invitation. The details of tuition, logistics, and licensing will evolve. What matters most is the movement—parents, educators, and students reclaiming a vision for education that is rigorous, flexible, Christ-centered, and deeply human.

Whether you’re a parent longing for something more, an educator looking for alignment, or a student searching for purpose—welcome. You’re not alone. True North is not just a program. It’s a path. And we’re just getting started.
