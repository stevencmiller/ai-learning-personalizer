# Chapter 4: Rediscovering True North

If the traditional system is broken, where do we turn?

We believe every child is born with purpose. That purpose shouldn’t be buried beneath standardized benchmarks or squeezed into a system designed for someone else’s success. Instead, we must help each student discover their own *True North*—a direction aligned with their unique strengths, interests, values, and goals.

True North Learning is rooted in three core beliefs:

1. **Every student has untapped potential**  
   Not just academic potential, but emotional, creative, and spiritual potential. School should be a place that nurtures the *whole child*.

2. **Purpose-driven learning is powerful learning**  
   When students know *why* they’re learning, engagement skyrockets. When they see how their learning connects to the world and their future, they lean in.

3. **Personalized paths honor individual journeys**  
   Not every child will walk the same route—or at the same pace. True North embraces this, offering flexible, competency-based learning maps that empower students to move forward with confidence and clarity.

This chapter reframes education through the lens of purpose, agency, and faith. It invites readers to consider how education might look if we aligned our practices not with the old model—but with the hearts and hopes of real children.
