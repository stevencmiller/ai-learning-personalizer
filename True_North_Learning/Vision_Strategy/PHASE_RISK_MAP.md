# 🧭 True North Learning: Phase Risk Map & Strategic Foresight

This document outlines potential roadblocks across each major development phase of the True North Learning Platform and School, along with mitigation strategies to maintain the mission and momentum through soft launch, pilot, and scalable growth.

## 📍 Phase 1: Diagnostic + Core Curriculum Foundation (Now)

**🎯 Goal:** Launch standards-aligned diagnostic engine, personalized learning paths, and modular core content (Math ELA Science).

**Potential Roadblocks & Solutions**
| Role | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| 👨‍💻 Developer | Building a scalable diagnostic system across states | Begin with 1 grade + 1–2 subjects; Use modular YAML/JSON-based architecture |
| 🎓 Educator | Superficial or procedural diagnostic questions | Anchor all diagnostics to deep skill clusters and standards |
| 💼 Business | No monetization yet; funding gap | Begin outreach to 1–2 schools/districts for potential co-design partnerships |

## 📍 Phase 2: Platform MVP + Afternoon Module Roadmap

**🎯 Goal:** Soft-launch student dashboard, core diagnostics, and early personalized modules (PBL, enrichment options).

**Potential Roadblocks & Solutions**
| Role | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| 👨‍💻 Developer | Feature bloat or tech debt | MVP scope limited to dashboard, diagnostics, path engine |
| 🎓 Educator | Lack of engagement or balance between structure and choice | Design “choice within structure” through learning menus and project playlists |
| 💼 Business | Trying to scale and launch the school simultaneously | Use the school as an incubator/lab for the platform; build credibility first |

## 📍 Phase 3: Wyoming Soft Launch – Private School Cohort (2025–2026)

**🎯 Goal:** Operate small founding family pilot in Wyoming; test entire end-to-end flow and refine based on real student data.

**Potential Roadblocks & Solutions**
| Role | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| 👨‍💻 Developer | Bugs or incomplete features for live learners | Run a simulated “shadow launch” one month prior |
| 🎓 Educator | Students need more social or teacher contact | Bake in virtual community huddles, morning sessions, exhibition showcases |
| 💼 Business | Enrollment or cost concerns | Offer “Founding Family Scholarships” in exchange for feedback + testimonials |

---

## 📍 Phase 4: Licensing + Multi-State Expansion (AZ Next – 2026–2027)

**🎯 Goal:** Begin multi-campus licensing OR virtual school model expansion in voucher-friendly or ESA-enabled states (e.g., Arizona).

**Potential Roadblocks & Solutions**
| Role | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| 👨‍💻 Developer | Need for multi-tenant or white-labeled infrastructure | Build with modularity and simple authentication from start |
| 🎓 Educator | Accreditation requirements may restrict flexibility | Partner with Cognia or ACSI for hybrid compliance model |
| 💼 Business | Public/private confusion or barriers to adoption | Use dual-brand model: True North Academy (faith-based) vs True North Learning (platform-neutral licensing) |

## 🏁 Core Principles for Staying on Course

- **Anchored in Purpose:** Every decision must align with guiding students toward their God-given calling through excellent, joyful learning.
- **Open-Handed Vision:** Remain flexible in method, but never in mission.
- **Build Slowly, Launch Strongly:** Focus deeply on one successful pilot in 2025–2026. Then use the data, testimonials, and refined model to expand in 2026–2027 and beyond.
