# True North PDLE: 8th Grade Math Learning Progression

This outline provides a standards-aligned progression path for 8th grade math to be used within the Personalized Diagnostic Learning Engine (PDLE).

---

## Unit 1: Expressions & Equations
- I can evaluate expressions using the order of operations.
- I can solve linear equations with one variable.
- I can apply the distributive property to simplify expressions.

## Unit 2: Linear Relationships
- I can identify proportional relationships in tables, graphs, and equations.
- I can calculate slope from a graph or two points.
- I can interpret the slope and y-intercept in context.

## Unit 3: Functions
- I can determine if a relation is a function.
- I can compare functions using graphs, tables, and equations.
- I can construct a function to model a linear relationship.

## Unit 4: Geometry
- I can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to solve problems.
- I can find the distance between two points in a coordinate plane.
- I can calculate volume of cones, cylinders, and spheres.

## Unit 5: Statistics & Probability
- I can interpret scatter plots and describe associations.
- I can construct and analyze two-way frequency tables.
- I can estimate lines of best fit.
