# True North Learning Platform  
## Reimagining Education Through Faith, Formation & AI

### Executive Summary
True North is a Christ-centered, AI-powered learning platform designed to personalize education for every student while developing their whole person â€” spiritually, academically, socially, and emotionally. Our mission is to transform the traditional model of education by integrating intelligent diagnostics, soft skill development, biblical values, and modern project-based learning into a two-hour core learning framework.

Launching as a hybrid homeschool/private school model in Fall 2025, True North aims to serve families, microschools, and faith-driven institutions with a fully personalized, spiritually grounded education solution.

### The Problem: Fragmented Education, Forgotten Formation
Today's education system â€” both public and private â€” often lacks:
- True personalization rooted in a studentâ€™s readiness, learning style, or faith identity
- Integration of soft skills, leadership, and communication within academic subjects
- Support for parents who want to disciple their children while ensuring academic rigor
- Tools that honor both emotional wellness and spiritual growth in a digital age

Meanwhile, AI in education is growing â€” but often untethered to truth, discipleship, or human formation.

True North offers a redemptive alternative: AI as a guide for holistic growth, not just academic achievement.

It is a movement. A living platform of personalized, purpose-rooted formation.
One that equips students not just for tests â€” but for truth, life, calling, and eternity.

We believe Jesus is the ultimate Teacher. The Spirit is the ultimate Guide. And AI, rightly stewarded, can help restore education to its rightful place â€” in service to the flourishing of image-bearers, led by faith, love, and wisdom.
